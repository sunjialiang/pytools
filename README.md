This repository contains small utility scripts written in Python.

## Excel Example

`test.py` demonstrates basic Excel operations using the `openpyxl` library.
It creates an Excel file, appends two rows of data, and prints the contents.
To run the script, install `openpyxl` first:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
python test.py
```
